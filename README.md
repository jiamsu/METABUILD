# METABUILD


Metaverse Architect, Designer, Game Designer Blockchain Single Platform
Provide a new platform for traditional architects and designers to exert the power of design and creation in WEB3


The outline of the envisioned requirements is as follows:

The platform will provide SANDBOX, DECENTRALAND, CRYPTAL VOXEL and other metaverse landowners to publish construction requirements, and design modelers can freely accept orders in METABUILD after registration.
Provide a fixed price charge standard, such as how many ETH or BTC per pixel or how many meters
The platform randomly distributes designers to those who need land for construction, as long as the design is started, 30% of the tokens will be paid
Each designer has two opportunities to communicate with Party A. The first time the plan is not satisfied, and after the modification, if the second time is still not satisfied, the designer can be replaced.
Seek a more fair and reasonable interaction and payment mechanism for owners and designers
The platform can link WEB3 wallet, and all interactions are done on the chain
